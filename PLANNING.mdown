- add a macro to remove the prefix
- assert macros
- test steps that can be run ad hoc
- multiple setUp/tearDown blocks per suite
- prototypal suite inheritance?
- it feels like the test runner, test suite, and test case classes are basically all the same thing
	- protocol for test-y things?
	- one class for all three?
	- a collection of tests
- assertions should be passed to tests and setup/teardown functions separately from test cases and suites?
