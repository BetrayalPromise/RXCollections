- config macro to remove the prefix
- test steps that can be run at test casesâ€™ discretion
- multiple setUp/tearDown blocks per suite
- differential-prototypal suite inheritance?
- composable contexts (inheriting setUp/tearDown/stateClass/steps from parent context)?
- post run state to NSUserNotificationCenter
- can events nest?
	When a test suite runs a test case, the case would start a new test case event (immediately filing it with the event sink) and then pass the successes/failures and test ending into it. This would make it easier for the visitors to see the structure of the tests without having to build stacks or anything.
